# Elementary-Programming-Project
### A very simple graphical user interface to plot spectroscopy. 
### Project Description:
In electron spectroscopy matter is examined by radiating it with a bright light and measuring the kinetic energy of electrons that come off it. When the photonic energy of light and kinetic energy of the electrons are known, they can be used to derive the amount of force that was required to break off the electrons. This provides valuable information about the matter's electron structure, and its chemical and physical properties. This phenomenon where photons break off electrons is called photoionization, and the broken off electrons are called photoelectrons.
